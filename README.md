## Multisensor Remote Sensing: From terrestrial to Planetary Applications

-A broader frontier in remote sensing-based lithological analysis lies in comparative planetology, which extends terrestrial geological principles to other planetary bodies. This discipline facilitates the interpretation of in planetary parameters such as gravity, atmospheric composition, and geological evolution. Although orbital and rover missions have provided high-resolution surface imaging of terrestrial planets like Mars, and the Moon, subsurface knowledge remains limited.
