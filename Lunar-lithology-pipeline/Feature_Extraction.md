**Spectral Features**

- Band ratios(950/750 nm for mafics, 1500/2000 nm for OH-bearing)
- Spectral angle mapper (SAM) to reference mineral endmembers
- Continum removal for absorption feature analysis

**Radar Features**

- CPR (circular polarization ratio) for roughness
- backscatter coefficients at multiple incidence anlges
- polarimetric decompositions (α-entropy-anisotropy)


**Morphometric features**

- Slope, curvature, roughness from DEMs
- Crater density and degradation state
- Rock abundance models
