## Why this Exists

Lunar geology mapping faces unique challenges: extreme illumination conditions, complex surface textures, and limited ground truth.

- Standaidizing lunar data processing workflows
- Automating feature extraction across multiple data sources
- Providing reproducible machine learning approaches for lithology classificaiton.
-
